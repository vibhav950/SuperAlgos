# SuperAlgos

Documenting my journey of learning super-optimized algorithms.

**Note:** All instances of code snippets, algorithms, or ideas employed in these implementations have been sourced from the public domain, and I have cited them in the respective files.

## Current catalogue

* [vfast_qsort.c](src/vfast_qsort.c) - sort large arrays very fast using quicksort.
* [vfast_vec.h](src/vfast_vec.h) - fast C++ style vector implementation using macros.
